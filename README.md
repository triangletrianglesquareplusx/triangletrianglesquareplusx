# Hi :bowtie:, my name is Preslav

**`Constant Do-er (Learning/Creating/Filmmaking)`**

I am an indie developer seeking to learn new tech constantly, share the journey and land the perfect job.

There are many jobs out there but the one I am searching for has to be in a good team which is working on a challenging project and most importantly - an environment where asking questions is encouraged.
